# Analyzing NYPD Shooting Incidents

**Introduction:**

This research delves into a comprehensive dataset of shooting incidents in a major metropolitan area, with the primary goal of uncovering underlying patterns. The focus is on two critical aspects: the timing of these incidents and the demographic characteristics of both the victims and the perpetrators involved. A significant part of the analysis is dedicated to examining how specific times of the day and different days of the week might influence the likelihood and severity of shooting events. By conducting this analysis, the study aims to shed light on critical temporal and demographic factors that play a role in urban shootings. The ultimate objective is to harness these insights to enhance crime prevention strategies. The findings are expected to be particularly beneficial for law enforcement agencies and policymakers, enabling them to devise more effective and targeted approaches to reducing such incidents. Through this investigation, the study contributes valuable knowledge towards improving public safety and understanding the dynamics of urban crime.

**Dataset:**

In the dataset, the columns are classified into different types of data according to the NOIR system. Nominal data, which includes categorical data without an inherent order, is represented by columns such as 'BORO', 'LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC', 'LOC_CLASSFCTN_DESC', 'LOCATION_DESC', 'STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG', 'PERP_SEX', 'PERP_RACE', 'VIC_SEX', 'VIC_RACE', and 'JURISDICTION_CODE'. Ordinal data, containing categories with a meaningful order but no consistent intervals, is found in 'PERP_AGE_GROUP' and 'VIC_AGE_GROUP'. The 'OCCUR_TIME' column, which provides the time of each incident, is classified as interval data, having meaningful intervals but no true zero point. Lastly, ratio data, which includes numerical data with a true zero point, is represented by 'INCIDENT_KEY', 'X_COORD_CD', 'Y_COORD_CD', 'Latitude', 'Longitude', and 'Lon_Lat', all of which involve measurable quantities and distances. This dataset offers a comprehensive view of shooting incidents, providing valuable insights into the patterns and characteristics of such events. The inclusion of detailed demographic data for both perpetrators and victims, along with precise geolocation information, makes it a rich source for in-depth analysis of urban crime patterns, aiding in the development of targeted crime prevention strategies and informed policymaking.
